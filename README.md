# herdr-model-lanes

For strict-priority, per-role native Claude/Codex launches through CLIProxyAPI,
see [role routing](ROLE_ROUTING.md). `bin/ag-role` reads external role policies
and refuses to launch when no allowed route has capacity.

Herdr 0.8 plugin that shows the remaining weekly subscription capacity for
**ChatGPT Codex** and **Claude Max** in the focused workspace row. A normal
value looks like:

```text
Cx 6%!! · 2d17h | Cl 91% · 5d13h
```

`!` means below 20% remaining, `!!` means below 10%, and `~` marks stale data.
Claude's five-hour or Sonnet allowance appears only when it is tighter than the
overall weekly allowance or below 20%.

## Data sources and credential boundary

Codex is queried through the official local app-server over stdio JSON-RPC:

```text
codex app-server --listen stdio://
```

The plugin selects the rate-limit window near 10,080 minutes and rejects
API-key authentication rather than presenting it as subscription usage. It
does not read `auth.json` or Codex transcripts. Codex support is
credential-blind and cross-platform.

Claude Max usage comes primarily from the documented Claude Code
`statusLine` feed, captured by the bundled `claude_statusline.py`
collector. Configure Claude Code's `statusLine` command to
`bin/claude-statusline` (or `python3 claude_statusline.py`); any command
placed after `--` in that setting receives the original stdin JSON with
its stdout preserved, so an existing status-line script keeps working.
The collector reads at most 1 MiB of the status-line JSON and persists only
`captured_at` plus the normalized `five_hour` and `seven_day` windows
(the documented `used_percentage` normalized to `utilization`, plus the
reset epoch) under
`HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR`/`MODEL_LANES_STATE_DIR`/`XDG_STATE_HOME` at
`herdr/plugins/terry.herdr-model-lanes/claude-statusline.json`, written
atomically with mode `0600`. `session_id`, `model`, `cwd`, transcript
paths, and prompt data are never persisted. The bundled
`claude_max_usage.py` helper reads this cache before any credential or
network access and uses it while `captured_at` is no more than 30 minutes
old and the weekly window has not expired; `--refresh` does not bypass a
valid cache. **Claude support is experimental.** When the cache is missing,
stale, malformed, or expired, the helper falls back to the undocumented
OAuth endpoint. It is the sole credential boundary: on macOS it reads the
Claude Code OAuth token from the
login Keychain. On Linux it reads the same `claudeAiOauth` payload from
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`, or `~/.claude/.credentials.json` when
the variable is unset. The Linux read is bounded to 64 KiB and refuses
symlinks, non-regular files, files owned by another effective user, and files
with group or world permission bits. On any other platform the helper fails
clearly and Claude shows `n/a`. As a fallback the helper calls
`https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`. That endpoint is **undocumented
and unofficial**; it may change or disappear without notice. The main plugin
is credential-blind: it runs the helper as a bounded subprocess and receives
only the normalized `five_hour`, `seven_day`, and `seven_day_sonnet` windows.
No OAuth token or credential file value is ever placed in argv, logs, caches,
error messages, or files. Where the helper cannot run (an unsupported
platform, a locked Keychain, a missing or insecure credentials file, or a
signed-out session), Claude displays as `Cl n/a` while Codex keeps working.
With the statusLine feed configured, the endpoint fallback rarely runs and
Claude numbers track the same data Claude Code itself displays.

Grok quota comes from the bundled `grok_usage.py` helper in the same shape.
It is the sole credential boundary for Grok: it reads the login key from the
nested `~/.grok/auth.json` shape (top-level auth-host keys; only the `key`
field of the first entry) and calls
`https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/billing?format=credits`, printing only the
normalized weekly credits window from `config.creditUsagePercent` and
`config.currentPeriod.end`. A monthly period is an error, never a weekly
window. The key never appears in argv, logs, caches, or errors. The `Gk`
segment uses the same `!`/`!!`/`~` rules and 30-minute cadence as Claude with
its own atomic cache, shows `Gk n/a` when the helper cannot run, and appears
only when a Grok login exists on the machine.

GLM (Z.ai / bigmodel coding plan) quota comes from the bundled `glm_usage.py`
helper in the same shape. It is the sole credential boundary for GLM: the key
is looked up from `ZHIPU_API_KEY`, `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`, `ZAI_KEY`,
`BIGMODEL_API_KEY`, or `GLM_API_KEY` in the process environment, then the same
names in `~/.env.resolved`, then `~/.pi/agent/models.json`
(`providers["bigmodel-coding"]["apiKey"]`; `$`-prefixed env refs and
`!`-prefixed sialyl wrappers are ignored), then the first line of
`~/.config/zhipu/api_key` or `~/.config/bigmodel/api_key`. The helper calls
`GET {base}/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
and prints only the normalized five-hour token window (the `TOKENS_LIMIT`
entry with the nearest reset). The base is `https://open.bigmodel.cn` when the
key came from a Zhipu/BigModel source and `https://api.z.ai` otherwise,
overridable with `MODEL_LANES_GLM_BASE`. No key is ever stored, logged, or
cached. The `Gl` segment uses the same `!`/`!!`/`~` rules, refreshes at a
five-minute cadence (the window is five hours), shows `Gl n/a` when no key is
available, and the router judges it on a five-hour pace, not a weekly one.

Antigravity (Google `agy` CLI) quota comes from the bundled
`antigravity_usage.py` helper in the same shape. It is the sole credential
boundary for Antigravity: it discovers a same-user Antigravity.app
`language_server` (preferred) or a running `agy` process from `ps`/`lsof`,
reads the CSRF token from that process's argv when present, and POSTs
`RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` to `127.0.0.1` only. The CSRF token never appears
in argv constructed by this plugin, logs, caches, or errors. Self-signed TLS
is accepted only for that loopback host. The helper does **not** spawn `agy`
or the desktop app; if neither is already running, Antigravity displays as
`Ag n/a`. The `Ag` segment uses the same `!`/`!!`/`~` rules and 30-minute
cadence as Grok, and the router uses the tightest Gemini bucket (weekly, or
five-hour when that is more constrained). Claude/GPT buckets on the same
plan are not the routing window because a default `agy` session spends Gemini.

Kimi Code quota comes from the bundled `kimi_usage.py` helper in the same
shape. It is the sole credential boundary for Kimi Code: the key is looked
up from `KIMI_CODE_API_KEY` in the process environment, then
`~/.env.resolved`, then a still-fresh `access_token` in
`~/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`. Moonshot Open Platform keys
(`MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, `KIMI_API_KEY`) are a different product and are
ignored. The helper calls `GET https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages` and
prints only the tightest coding window (weekly membership, or the five-hour
rate limit when that remaining fraction is lower). It never reads or uses
the CLI refresh token, and the key never appears in argv, logs, caches, or
errors. The `Km` segment uses the same `!`/`!!`/`~` rules and a five-minute
cadence because a five-hour window can be the routing meter.

Cursor quota comes from the bundled `cursor_usage.py` helper in the same
shape. It is the sole credential boundary for Cursor: it reads
`cursorAuth/accessToken` from Cursor.app's local VS Code-style
`state.vscdb` (macOS Application Support, or `~/.config/Cursor` on Linux),
refuses a JWT with under 60 seconds left, and calls
`GET https://cursor.com/api/usage-summary` with cookie
`WorkosCursorSessionToken=::<token>`. The refresh token is never read. The
`Cu` segment uses the same `!`/`!!`/`~` rules and a 30-minute cadence, and
the router judges the monthly billing-cycle window on its own length.

## Refresh, caching, and failure behavior

Codex refreshes at most every five minutes. Claude refreshes at most every 30
minutes because Anthropic's usage endpoint rate-limits aggressively. A file
lock prevents concurrent Herdr events from duplicating either request.

Each source has a separate, atomically replaced normalized cache under
`HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR`. A source failure preserves its last value with `~`;
the other source remains live. Values older than six hours are discarded and
shown as `n/a`. A stale helper fallback retains its original age rather than
being made artificially fresh.

The `refresh` action bypasses both intervals. The Codex exchange has a
15-second absolute deadline; the helper subprocess has a 12-second bound, and
inside it the Keychain read and the HTTP request each have a five-second
timeout. Raw source responses and errors are not logged.

## Herdr behavior and configuration

The plugin publishes two sidebar tokens only to the focused workspace and
clears them, plus the legacy single `$model_quota` token, from every other
workspace. Herdr 0.8 has no global header or footer plugin slot, so the
clearest available surface is a dedicated line beneath the active workspace.
A 36-column minimum keeps both rows visible:

```toml
[ui]
sidebar_width = 36
sidebar_min_width = 36

[ui.sidebar.spaces]
rows = [
  ["state_icon", "workspace"],
  ["$model_quota_core"],
  ["$model_quota_other"],
  ["branch", "git_status"],
]
```

The two rows use progressive disclosure. `$model_quota_core` carries only the
live Codex and Claude weekly windows, so the two subscriptions that gate
routing stay on the first line. `$model_quota_other` carries only the live
tighter Claude constraints (five-hour and Sonnet weekly windows) plus the
optional Grok, GLM, Antigravity, Kimi, and Cursor windows, so secondary
capacity is read only when the core line warrants a glance. Each row fits
whole compact segments such as `Cx 75%·2d0h` (separated by two spaces)
within 36 display columns; when live segments remain that cannot fit, the row
ends with a compact `+N` count instead of truncating a segment. A provider
without live data is omitted rather than shown as `n/a`, a row with no live
segment clears, and the `!`/`!!` warning and `~` stale marks carry over from
the full line. Herdr `refresh` stdout still prints the existing full one-line
quota string.

## Model-class routing

`route <class>` picks a lane for a new agent tab from the normalized caches
(refreshing them first if stale). Lanes are defined in `classes.toml` beside
the manifest. Two classes exist:

- **`high`** — Fable 5 (`claude --model claude-fable-5`, quota claude), then
  Sol 5.6 (`pi` on `openai-codex`/`gpt-5.6-sol`, quota codex). Fable keeps
  the Claude Max window as its headroom.
- **`medium`** — Sol 5.6, Opus 5 (`claude --model claude-opus-5`, quota
  claude), GLM-5.3 (`pi` on `bigmodel-coding`, quota glm, not
  classified-safe), Grok 4.6 (grok), Antigravity (`agy`, quota antigravity, not
  classified-safe), Kimi Code (`kimi`, quota kimi, not classified-safe),
  Cursor Agent (cursor, quota cursor). The order follows Terminal-Bench 3.0
  and vendor cards (Opus 5 42.7 vs Grok 4.6 26.5; GLM-5.3 28–32); Fable and
  Opus share the one Claude Max window, so the health gate, not order,
  protects `high`: Opus is picked only while Claude is on pace and above
  20%. `agy`, `kimi`, and `cursor` are in the picker so unused Google, Kimi
  Code, and Cursor quota can be spent by confirmation or number override
  even when an earlier lane is healthy.

For each lane the router computes
`health = (remaining/100) / ((resets_at - now) / window_seconds)` and picks:

1. among candidates (`health >= 1`, `remaining >= 20`), the highest-health
   lane whose reset is within `SURPLUS_RESET_WINDOW_SECS` (48h) and whose
   health is at least `SURPLUS_HEALTH` (2.0) — spend headroom that expires
   with the window ("surplus before reset");
2. otherwise the first candidate in class order ("first healthy lane in
   order");
3. otherwise the lane with the highest health ("least unhealthy lane").

A lane whose quota has no reader is `n/a` and ranks last. `--explain` prints
one line per lane plus the pick and shows it as
a Herdr notification (non-fatal without Herdr); `--launch` additionally
creates the tab, echoes the rationale line into the new pane, and starts
the agent; `--argv` prints the chosen lane's shell-quoted command on stdout
with the rationale on stderr and needs no Herdr environment. Routing
happens once at launch; nothing re-routes a running pane.

### `ag`

`bin/ag` is a thin argparse wrapper around `herdr_model_lanes.py ag`.
`ag --help` is the contract. Default class is `medium`. It prints each
lane's quota, stars the suggestion, and execs the chosen agent in this
shell — no new tab, own cwd, Herdr detects the agent normally.

```text
ag              # picker, then exec
ag high         # Fable or Sol
ag --classified # hide glm, agy, kimi
ag medium -y    # skip the prompt
```

Enter starts the star, a number starts that lane, `q` quits. After
`AG_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 10) it starts the suggestion. `AG_YES=1`
skips the prompt. It sets `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` to
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/herdr/plugins/terry.herdr-model-lanes`
when unset. Install it as a symlink so updates are picked up:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/bin/ag" ~/.local/bin/ag
```

`ag usage` prints one row per configured provider (Codex, Claude, Grok, GLM,
Antigravity, Kimi Code, Cursor) with remaining percentage and reset
countdown, reusing the same cached readers. Human-readable rows spell out
the provider and the quota window the reader selects while keeping the
compact abbreviation used elsewhere: `Codex weekly (Cx)`, `Claude weekly
(Cl)`, `Grok weekly (Gk)`, `GLM 5h (Gl)`, `Antigravity Gemini (Ag)` (the
tightest Gemini bucket), `Kimi coding (Km)` (weekly membership or the
five-hour rate limit, whichever is tighter), and `Cursor monthly (Cu)`.
The picker and sidebar stay compact (`Cx`, `Cl`, …), and `--json` emits a
stable machine-readable object keyed by provider name; `--refresh` bypasses
each reader's cache. A failed provider prints `n/a` with its error without
suppressing the others; the exit code is nonzero only if every provider
fails or the invocation is invalid.

`ag usage --plan` adds a read-only planning state to every row. `unknown`
means the window is missing, stale, or expired. `conserve` means less than
20% remains or capacity is more than 5% behind the window's pace. Planning
uses this 5% tolerance to absorb rounded provider data. `surplus` means a
window longer than 48 hours resets within 48 hours with at least 20% remaining
and at least twice the required pace. Every other healthy window is `on_pace`.
The routing health threshold remains unchanged.
The summary may recommend pulling forward at most one ready, verifiable task,
and stops after one accepted artifact. Capacity is not demand, so the command
never recommends creating work merely to consume quota. With `--json --plan`,
each provider includes `state` and the top level includes `recommendation`.

Kill rule: if Herdr's plugin action log shows no `route` invocation in the
two weeks after landing, delete the route action.

## Installation

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Herdr 0.8+, and `codex` on `PATH`. Claude usage prefers the Claude Code `statusLine` feed — set
Claude Code's `statusLine` command to `bin/claude-statusline` from this
repository; the endpoint fallback additionally requires macOS with the
Claude Code CLI signed in, or Linux with
a `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` equivalent) owned by
the current user with `0600`-style permissions. Grok support
additionally requires a Grok CLI login under `~/.grok`. GLM support
additionally requires a Z.ai/BigModel API key from one of the sources above.
Antigravity support additionally requires Antigravity.app or `agy` already
running so the loopback quota server can be probed. Kimi Code support
additionally requires `KIMI_CODE_API_KEY` or a signed-in Kimi Code CLI.
Cursor support additionally requires a signed-in Cursor.app session.

Install the pinned release from GitHub:

```bash
herdr plugin install terry-li-hm/herdr-model-lanes --ref v3.8.0
```

Then add the sidebar configuration above, run `herdr server reload-config`, and
populate both values with
`herdr plugin action invoke terry.herdr-model-lanes.refresh`.

Track `main` only if you accept unreleased changes. For local development,
clone the repository and use `herdr plugin link /path/to/herdr-model-lanes`
instead of installing.

## Rollback

Run `herdr plugin action invoke terry.herdr-model-lanes.clear`, then
`herdr plugin uninstall terry.herdr-model-lanes` (or `herdr plugin unlink` for a
linked checkout) and reload Herdr. The normalized
cache remains under the Herdr-managed plugin state directory and contains no
credentials; deleting that directory removes every trace.

## Limitations

- Claude numbers come primarily from the Claude Code `statusLine` feed and
  fall back to an unofficial Anthropic endpoint that may break at any time;
  Claude numbers remain best-effort and experimental.
- Claude usage requires macOS (Keychain) or Linux (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or
  `~/.claude` credentials file with owner-only permissions); other platforms
  show `n/a`.
- Codex, Claude, Grok, GLM, Antigravity, Kimi Code, and Cursor are the
  supported quota providers. Antigravity quota is available only while
  Antigravity.app or `agy` is already running. Kimi Code uses the coding
  membership API, not Moonshot Open Platform balance. Cursor uses the
  local Cursor.app session, not `CURSOR_API_KEY`.

See `SECURITY.md` for the trust model and reporting channels.

`ag` prints each lane's quota with the suggested lane marked `*`, then waits: Enter (or `AG_TIMEOUT` seconds of silence, default 10) starts the suggestion, a number starts that lane instead, `q` quits; `ag -y` (or `AG_YES=1`) skips the prompt. Inside Herdr it also renames the pane to `<class>: <lane>` and shows the pick as a notification.

## Using `ag` without Herdr

Herdr is only the front end. The quota readers talk to Codex, Anthropic, Grok, GLM, and a local
Antigravity server
directly, lane selection is a pure function over their caches, and `ag` makes no
Herdr call unless `HERDR_PANE_ID` is set. In any shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/terry-li-hm/herdr-model-lanes ~/code/herdr-model-lanes
ln -s ~/code/herdr-model-lanes/bin/ag ~/.local/bin/ag
export MODEL_LANES_STATE_DIR=~/.local/state/model-lanes   # optional; any writable dir
ag --explain
ag            # execs the chosen lane in this shell
```

The Claude Max reader works on macOS (Keychain) and Linux (credentials file);
elsewhere the Claude lanes show `n/a` and rank last, while Codex, Grok, GLM,
and Antigravity lanes route normally when their sources are present.

Surplus applies only to windows longer than 48 hours; a five-hour window (GLM) always resets soon and refills anyway, so it never overrides class order on surplus alone.
